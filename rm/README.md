# Rock n Mine Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build a predictive system using **Logistic Regression** to classify sonar data into **Rocks** or **Mines**. It runs on **Google Colab** and includes steps to set up the environment, use the dataset, and train the model.

## Requirements

Before running the project, you need the following:

- **Google Colab**: A cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment.
- **Python libraries**:
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn

> **Note:** These libraries come pre-installed in Google Colab.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Open Google Colab
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Create a new notebook.

### Step 2: Upload or Copy the Code
You can either:
- **Upload** the `.ipynb` notebook file if you have it saved, or
- **Copy and paste** the code from the project directly into the notebook.

### Step 3: Upload the Data
The dataset used for this project is the **Sonar Data Set** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. You can download it from this link:

- [Sonar Data Set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pQxtljlNVh0DHYg-Ye7dtpDTlFceHVfa/view)

In Google Colab:
1. After downloading the file, click the folder icon on the left-hand sidebar in Colab.
2. Click **Upload** and select the `sonar data.csv` file from your computer.

> **Note:** Ensure the file is uploaded before proceeding to the next steps.

## Data Collection

The dataset consists of 60 sonar signal attributes for each object, which are labeled as:
- **R** (Rock)
- **M** (Mine)

---

## Data Processing

Steps to process the data:
1. **Load the data** into a DataFrame.
2. **Explore the data** to understand its structure and statistics.
3. **Split the data** into features (X) and labels (Y).

---

## Model Training

The model used is **Logistic Regression** for binary classification. To train the model:
1. **Split the dataset** into training and testing sets.
2. **Train the model** using the training set.
3. **Fit the model** on the training data.

---

## Model Evaluation

After training, evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy on both training and test datasets to measure its performance. Compare the accuracy metrics to understand how well the model generalizes.

---

## Making Predictions

Once the model is trained, you can:
1. **Input new data**: Provide new sonar readings to the model.
2. **Predict the class**: The model will predict whether the object is a Rock or a Mine.
3. **Interpret the results**: The output will indicate whether the new input corresponds to a Rock ('R') or a Mine ('M').
